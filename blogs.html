        <p>
          Lately I’ve been musing on alot of things. I'm consciously trying to
          avoid the words 'struggling with’ because these things make me realize
          areas I need to grow in. One big thing on my mind is staying true and
          grounded to my faith. As I grow older, I’ve realized that I had been
          taking a lot of important things for granted, and I’ve been working on
          being the grown adult I want myself to be, by being intentional about
          my financial, career, education, and life after-35 goals. These seem
          to be taking shape, but I’m struggling with actually staying grounded
          to my faith goals. I am on the lukewarm side and I detest it.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I was 15 or 16, someone (who I still can’t remember no matter how
          hard I try) once told me, as you grow older, it becomes even harder
          than you think to create time to grow within your faith. And I never
          showed it, but deep down I scoffed—a gentle scoff, of course. Because
          when I was young, things like praying, casual conversing with God, and
          even jisting were effortless. It felt like an ordinary thing, and I
          had thought surely the relationship will grow and become better as
          time passed. But now, as I sit and think of how I long for those days,
          I know that person was right.
        </p>

        <p>
          I still try to create time for God, but there’s that spiritual
          connection that is missing, and I know why it’s missing because it was
          never about the conversations or the prayers; it was about the habits
          that kept Him close. I realized that in the past, there were no
          distracting habits, just struggling to get that perfect grade,
          laughing and having good conversations with friends, looking forward
          to a good meal, and that was it. Nothing ever crossed me to the level
          of losing my temper and crying out angrily. The only thing that could
          cross me was when my housemate decided to throw my wet clothes to the
          floor because she wanted to hang hers. But that’s easily dismissable,
          right? It’s not that deep. And at night when I slept, I would talk to
          God about it and say to please forgive her, and it never burdened me.
          But right now, having such a scenario happen to me might through me
          into a mental spiral. Point is, there are more things that are now
          proving hard to navigate and with more of this I feel farthest from
          His presence. To keep my sanity, I’ve taken some time away from Our
          jisting, casual conversations (maybe I’m delusional but yes they were
          conversations) to help me deal with the constant trials.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the past, the gentle inner voice(believers say it is the Holy
          Spirit, and I’m usually more inclined to thinking of it as the voice
          of God) which I had come to recognize distinctively, would guide me
          through every emotion, every action. But somehow, that connection has
          slipped away. I pray to revive it, and I know the how-to, but it's not
          happening. I fully know it is in the habits I’ve picked up gradually
          that are pushing Him away. But those very habits are my coping
          mechanisms. So, the question is—how do I learn to let them go?
