# Random-Muses
Random  Muses is my personal blog that focuses on the three things I love most:
1. Music
2. Books
3. Art

And like the name, all the posts are random muses in my daily life :smiley:

## Contributing
Yes I welcome contributions, so go ahead and create that PR!

## Credits
I give credits to my uke, stack of books(both read and unread) and of course my sketch & note pads :wink:
